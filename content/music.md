# Music

Here, I've listed some of the music I made in chronological order.

## 2023, 2022 and 2021

I didn't make many songs in these years. I was either working, studying or travelling most of the time. There was COVID-19, and I didn't like the music I was doing, etc. I was mostly out of touch with music. I felt like I was lagging in my music-making and decided to quit my full-time job to study music for a year. I know one year isn't much time, but I hope it will (at least) put me out of my dilemma between a career in software and music.

## 2020

This year was very productive. I made many covers, and my singing improved a lot. I was on the verge of collaborating with many people, but COVID happened! Everything came to a standstill after that. I was delusional that COVID had not affected my life at all, but after some retrospection, I've realised that the reality is very different.

## 2019

I think I made the most number of tracks in this year. I thought I'd find a good singer in college, but those attempts failed. So, I had to sing the songs myself. I wouldn't say I enjoyed it much. I had to compromise the quality of the tracks because of my vocals. The original tracks that I made were fewer since I found that I didn't learn anything new by doing whatever I already knew. I wish I had a better singer to sing for me.

## 2018

I made quite a lot of original stuff this year, but I finished only a handful of them. I did a few remixes. I like them. The original tracks that I made, too, were not bad at all. But I didn't know where to go from here. I was stuck. It was the time I started experimenting with my vocals by making covers, etc. It was the time I joined college as well. I had new friends to show my work. I think that was a big motivator.

## 2017

I was considering a career in music at this point. I had fallen in love with the process of making music. It was my last year in school, and I had to decide on a career. I wanted to be a professional musician. The passion was soaring high. But things didn't go that route. Maybe I'm not that passionate anymore. I don't know if that's because I have an alternative career with better prospects now. It is funny how short-lived feelings and emotions are!

## 2016

I think I finally got a grip on music production this year. I was dabbling with different software and plugins in 2015 (the year I discovered music-making). When I work on songs nowadays, I aim to recreate the same fire / whatever I had during these times. When I made music in 2016, there were no expectations. It was more like a video game for me. Those were the good times!
