# Contact me

The *preferred* method to reach me is via this email,
- **joust_kernel.2j@icloud.com** [(alias of my personal email)]{.small-font}

I don't check my social media accounts often (and my notifications are disabled); but you can try your luck here,
- **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/sharavananpa)**
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharavananpa/)**
- **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_sharavananpa/)**

The *best* way (in my opinion) is to WhatsApp me. And, of course, you will have to know somebody who knows me to get my number!

There is one other *gimmicky* way. You can **[chat with me](https://sharavananpa.dev/anonymous-chat/)** anonymously.
