This was the first time I've been outside Coimbatore during Pongal. I've never seen Chennai like this before. My roommate and I went to <a href="https://www.tamilnadutourism.tn.gov.in/destinations/thiruvanmiyur-beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thiruvanmiyur beach</a> in the morning and spent an hour or two there. The beach was nearly empty, the roads were vacant and the weather was top-notch. It was the complete opposite of how I’ve perceived Chennai so far.</p><p>After that, we headed back to a <a href="https://www.geethamveg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant</a> near our house. It was extremely helpful for people like me to have restaurants open during Pongal, but I do feel sorry for their employees. I hope they’re not exploited and are paid fairly. That said, they seemed pretty happy that day. They wished us well and even served us some Sakkarai Pongal — it was delicious.</p></div><ul class="post-metadata"><li><span class="post-tag"><a href="/tags/pongal/">pongal</a>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span class="post-tag"><a href="/tags/chennai/">chennai</a>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span class="post-tag"><a href="/tags/festival/">festival</a></span></li></ul><ul class="links-nextprev"><li class="links-nextprev-prev">← Previous<br><a href="/writings/disinformation-peddling/">Disinformation Peddling</a></li><li class="links-nextprev-next">Next →<br><a href="/writings/project-2028/">Where do I see myself in 2028?</a></li></ul></heading-anchors></main><footer><p><em><a href="/feed/feed.xml" target="_blank">Subscribe</a>.
